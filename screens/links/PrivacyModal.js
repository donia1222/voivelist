Information Collection and Subscriptions

Voice Shopping list  does not collect personally identifiable information from users. For subscriptions, we use a service provider (e.g., RevenueCat), which assigns an anonymous identifier for each user. This identifier is not used to personally identify the user.

The information collected for subscriptions is solely for processing payments and managing subscriptions efficiently. This information is treated with the highest confidentiality and security.

Use of Information

We use the anonymous subscription information for the following purposes:

To process payment transactions.
To manage active and expired subscriptions.
To provide technical support and customer assistance.
To enhance the quality of our app and services.
Data Storage

Subscription data, while anonymous, is stored securely and is accessible only by authorized personnel and our subscription service provider.

Sharing Personal Information

We do not share any personally identifiable information because we do not collect such information. Anonymous subscription information is not shared with third parties except for the purposes of processing payments and managing subscriptions as described.

User Rights

Users may inquire about whether DogMentor holds personal data about them, request correction of incorrect data, or request deletion of personal data under certain circumstances, even though we do not collect personally identifiable data.
